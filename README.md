## Some Leanrings + Adventures from My Projects

### [1. Shiny App Visualization](https://github.com/jaredc7/research_public/blob/main/app.R)

**Overview**

Spent some time working with Dr.Saraf to visualize networks of IT firms and industry standards set by them. Created this R Shiny app to help create data-rich, interactive and quick time based visualizations. Besides visualizations I worked on developing code base to scrape over 600 IT standards, clean unstructured data and organize time-series data. Some of that code (working condition) can be found [here](https://github.com/jaredc7/research_public).

### [2. Charity Site](https://github.com/jaredc7/465_project)

**Overview**

Not quite a data focused project, but was learning mostly backend PHP and javascript functionalities to create a "Movember" Foundation website. Technologies I learnt along the way was MAMP, MySQLWorkbench and Apache. Not anything new but an interesting project to think about how data is collected and can be improved from start to analysis.
