## Some Leanrings + Adventures from My Projects

### [1. Shiny App Visualization](https://github.com/jaredc7/research_public/blob/main/app.R): 

**Overview**

Spent some time working with Dr.Saraf to visualize networks of IT firms and industry standards set by them. Created this R Shiny app to help create data-rich, interactive and quick time based visualizations. Besides visualizations I worked on developing code base to scrape over 600 IT standards, clean unstructured data and organize time-series data. Some of that code (working condition) can be found [here](https://github.com/jaredc7/research_public).
